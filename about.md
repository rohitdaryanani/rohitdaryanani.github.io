I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Global Zeal Inc. A startup company based in Cebu Philippines.

I'm into video games mostly on console usually play jrpg, sony exclusives(Uncharted, last of us and god of war and more).

At University of San Carlos i took up computer engineering mostly because i thought we were gonna build robots.
